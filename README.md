# Pryv data types

Events are the primary units of content in the Pryv.io data model. Depending on its type, an event can represent anything related to a particular time (picture, note, data measurement, etc).

We provide you with a list of **standard event types** used in Pryv that you can customize to suit your needs as explained below.

## Effective version

The event types effectively in use by default are published on [our API site](https://api.pryv.com/event-types/).

## How to customize your data types

*Prerequisites:* Node v12

You must [fork](https://github.com/pryv/data-types/fork) this repository, add the data types that you want to validate and host it on a URL where it will be loaded by Pryv.io on boot.

The format validation follows the [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org) specification and Pryv.io uses the [z-schema](https://github.com/zaggino/z-schema) library for validation.

To add and modify your own data types, you can follow these steps:

#### 1- Fetch dependencies

run `npm install`

#### 2- Add files in the directory `/src-classes`

Filenames are not important as long as they end with `.json`.

The type of an event indicates how to handle its content and is specified as `{class}/{format}`. We recommend to separate classes in independent files with their corresponding filename for the sake of readability.

##### Content of a `{class}.json` file

Your custom data type should be specified in a JSON formated document as an `Object` with the following properties:

- **{class}** the class of the event type (specified as `{class}/{format}`). For example, an angle measurement will have the class `"angle"`.  
  - **formats** `Object` each property key will be a possible format of this class.  
    -  **{format}** the format of the event type (specified as `{class}/{format}`). For example, the format `"deg"` for degrees.  
      The content of these properties should follow [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/) format.  
      - **description** (optional) a `string` describing the format.  
      - **type** `Mixed` as per JSON schema.  
      - **extras** (optional) they will be stripped out in a separate "extra" place at build.  
  - **description** (optional) a `string` describing the class.  
  - **extras** (optional) can contain anything that would be relevant for your apps.  
    - **name** (optional)  
      - **{languageCode}** the name of this class in a specific language.  

Examples:

- Minimalist **angle.json** file

```json
{
  "angle": {
  "formats": {
    "deg": {
      "type": "number"
    },
    "grad": {
      "type": "number"
    }
  }
}
```

- Extended **angle.json** file

```json
{
  "angle": {
    "formats": {
      "deg": {
        "description": "Degrees",
        "type": "number",
        "extras": {
          "name": {
            "en": "Degrees",
            "fr": "Degrés"
          },
          "symbol": "°"
        }
      },
      "grad": {
        "description": "Grade",
        "type": "number",
        "extras": {
          "name": {
            "en": "Gradians",
            "fr": "Grades"
          },
          "symbol": "grad"
        }
      }
    },
    "description": "The figure formed by two rays.",
    "extras": {
      "name": {
        "en": "Angle",
        "fr": "Angle"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### 3- Build the document to `/dist`

run `npm run build`

Three new versions of files will be created in `/dist`:

- **event-types.json**  
- **flat.json**  
- **flat.min.json**  

Furthermore, the file `flat.json` will be validated.

#### 4- Publish these files on a web sever and expose flat.json or flat.min.json

The URL to the file `flat.json` or `flat.min.json` should be exposed by the [service information](https://api.pryv.com/reference/#service-info).

More information on the content validation for your custom data types can be found in the [Pryv.io Setup Guide](https://api.pryv.com/customer-resources/pryv.io-setup/#customize-event-types-validation).  

## Data types validation

To validate that the schemas you have provided have proper json structure, you may execute below script:

`npm run validate-schema <shema_path>`

where `schema_path` is a full path to the data type json file to validate.

Furthermore, to validate data type values against generated `flat.json` file (or any file with the same structure), following script may be used:

`npm run validate-content <content_validation_cases_path> <schema_path>`

where:

- `content_validation_cases_path` is a full path to json file with validation cases having following structure:

```json
  [
    {
        "type": "absorbed-dose/gy",
        "content": 45,
        "expected": "success"
    }
  ]
```

- `schema_path` is a full path to the data type json file to validate. Optional - if not provided, generated `flat.json` will be used.

## Contents

We present below the content of the three files generated in `dist/`:
  
### events-types.json

Event types represented in a hierarchical structure. It is mainly used for documentation generation purposes.  

Extract of the structure:  

```json
{
  "version": "0.x.0",
  "classes": {
      "angle": {
      "description": "The figure formed by two rays.",
      "formats": {
        "deg": {
          "description": "Degrees",
          "type": "number"
        },
        "grad": {
          "description": "Grade",
          "type": "number"
        }
      }
    },
    "note": {

        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### flat.json

Event types in a key / value structure. It is mainly used for applications that require data format validation.  

This file is the one that is exposed by the [service information](https://api.pryv.com/reference/#service-info) in the `eventTypes` property. Example: [https://reg.pryv.me/service/info](https://reg.pryv.me/service/info).

```json
{
  "version": "0.3.0",
  "types": {
    "angle/deg": {
      "description": "Degrees",
      "type": "number"
    },
    "angle/grad": {
      "description": "Grade",
      "type": "number"
    }
  },
  "extras": {
    "angle/deg": {
      "name": {
        "en": "Degrees",
        "fr": "Degrés"
      },
      "symbol": "°"
    },
    "angle/grad": {
      "name": {
